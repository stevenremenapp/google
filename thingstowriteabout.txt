1) the search box border! there's no border but the box-shadow. uncheck box-shadow in the console and the search disappears! also, rgba.
      can't simply make the border less opaque because it affects all the text typed within it
2) opacity of text
3) footer not stretching all the way across on smaller sized windows
4) cursor doesn't turn into a hand on buttons
5) header and footer absolutely positioned, not fixed
6) media queries:
      the header disappears at a certain width;
      the search bar is one size within a certain width and one size at larger widths
      the microphone has to be adjusted when the search box shrinks in width
7) the microphone in the search box!
      span background-image for the actual image
      nested in an a link so it's usable
      absolutely positioned within a relative wrapper
      text-align center on the parent element (.main-content) to center it
